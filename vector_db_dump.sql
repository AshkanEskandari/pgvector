Early Release ebooks, you get books in their earliest form—\nthe author’s raw and unedited content as he or she writes—so you\ncan take advantage of these technologies long before the official\nrelease of these titles. The following will be Chapter 9 in the final\nrelease of the book.\nAlthough most of the applications of Machine Learning today are based on supervised\nlearning (and as a result, this is where most of the investments go to), the vast\nmajority of the available data is actually unlabeled: we have the input features X, but\nwe do not have the labels y. Yann LeCun famously said that “if intelligence was a cake,\nunsupervised learning would be the cake, supervised learning would be the icing on\nthe cake, and reinforcement learning would be the cherry on the cake”.

a manufacturing production line and detect which items are defective. You can\nfairly easily create a system that will take pictures automatically, and this might give\nyou thousands of pictures every day. You can then build a reasonably large dataset in\njust a few weeks. But wait, there are no labels! If you want to train a regular binary\nclassifier that will predict whether an item is defective or not, you will need to label\nevery single picture as “defective” or “normal”. This will generally require human\nexperts to sit down and manually go through all the pictures. This is a long, costly\nand tedious task, so it will usually only be done on a small subset of the available pictures.\nAs a result, the labeled dataset will be quite small, and the classifier’s performance\nwill be disappointing. Moreover, every time the company makes any change to\nits products, the whole process will need to be started over from scratch.

to label every picture? Enter unsupervised learning.\nIn Chapter 8, we looked at the most common unsupervised learning task: dimensionality\nreduction. In this chapter, we will look at a few more unsupervised learning tasks\nand algorithms:\n• Clustering: the goal is to group similar instances together into clusters. This is a\ngreat tool for data analysis, customer segmentation, recommender systems,\nsearch engines, image segmentation, semi-supervised learning, dimensionality\nreduction, and more.\n• Anomaly detection: the objective is to learn what “normal” data looks like, and\nuse this to detect abnormal instances, such as defective items on a production\nline or a new trend in a time series.\n• Density estimation: this is the task of estimating the probability density function\n(PDF) of the random process that generated the dataset.

for some cake? We will start with clustering, using K-Means and DBSCAN,\nand then we will discuss Gaussian mixture models and see how they can be used for\ndensity estimation, clustering, and anomaly detection. \nClustering\nAs you enjoy a hike in the mountains, you stumble upon a plant you have never seen\nbefore. You look around and you notice a few more. They are not perfectly identical,\nyet they are sufficiently similar for you to know that they most likely belong to the\nsame species (or at least the same genus). You may need a botanist to tell you what\nspecies that is, but you certainly don’t need an expert to identify groups of similarlooking\nobjects. This is called clustering: it is the task of identifying similar instances \nand assigning them to clusters, i.e., groups of similar instances.\nJust like in classification, each instance gets assigned to a group.

4), where each instance’s species (i.e., its class) is represented with a different\nmarker. It is a labeled dataset, for which classification algorithms such as Logistic\nRegression, SVMs or Random Forest classifiers are well suited. On the right is the\nsame dataset, but without the labels, so you cannot use a classification algorithm anymore.\nThis is where clustering algorithms step in: many of them can easily detect the\ntop left cluster. It is also quite easy to see with our own eyes, but it is not so obvious\nthat the lower right cluster is actually composed of two distinct sub-clusters. That\nsaid, the dataset actually has two additional features (sepal length and width), not\n238 |represented here, and clustering algorithms can make good use of all features, so in\nfact they identify the three clusters fairly well (e.g., using a Gaussian mixture model,\nonly 5 instances out of 150 are assigned to the wrong cluster).\nClustering is used in a wide variety of applications, including:	{"source": "text.txt"}	76564ae4-f295-11ee-ad60-c475ab433add	dfacd10c-e763-4957-b601-6ea6ff90b289

For customer segmentation: you can cluster your customers based on their purchases,\ntheir activity on your website, and so on. This is useful to understand who\nyour customers are and what they need, so you can adapt your products and\nmarketing campaigns to each segment. For example, this can be useful in recommender\nsystems to suggest content that other users in the same cluster enjoyed.\n• For data analysis: when analyzing a new dataset, it is often useful to first discover\nclusters of similar instances, as it is often easier to analyze clusters separately.\n• As a dimensionality reduction technique: once a dataset has been clustered, it is\nusually possible to measure each instance’s affinity with each cluster (affinity is\nany measure of how well an instance fits into a cluster). Each instance’s feature\nvector x can then be replaced with the vector of its cluster affinities. If there are k\nclusters, then this vector is k dimensional.

the original feature vector, but it can preserve enough information for\nfurther processing.\n• For anomaly detection (also called outlier detection): any instance that has a low\naffinity to all the clusters is likely to be an anomaly. For example, if you have clustered\nthe users of your website based on their behavior, you can detect users with\nunusual behavior, such as an unusual number of requests per second, and so on.\nAnomaly detection is particularly useful in detecting defects in manufacturing, or\nfor fraud detection.\n• For semi-supervised learning: if you only have a few labels, you could perform\nclustering and propagate the labels to all the instances in the same cluster. This\ncan greatly increase the amount of labels available for a subsequent supervised\nlearning algorithm, and thus improve its performance.\nFor search engines: for example, some search engines let you search for images\nthat are similar to a reference image.

a clustering algorithm to all the images in your database: similar images\nwould end up in the same cluster. Then when a user provides a reference image,\nall you need to do is to find this image’s cluster using the trained clustering\nmodel, and you can then simply return all the images from this cluster.\n• To segment an image: by clustering pixels according to their color, then replacing\neach pixel’s color with the mean color of its cluster, it is possible to reduce the\nnumber of different colors in the image considerably. This technique is used in\nmany object detection and tracking systems, as it makes it easier to detect the\ncontour of each object.\nThere is no universal definition of what a cluster is: it really depends on the context,\nand different algorithms will capture different kinds of clusters. For example, some\nalgorithms look for instances centered around a particular point, called a centroid.\nOthers look for continuous regions of densely packed instances: these clusters can	{"source": "text.txt"}	76564ae7-f295-11ee-b2fc-c475ab433add	ec19fcaa-7a8a-4e9e-8b6e-f7514fc5aece

Some algorithms are hierarchical, looking for clusters of clusters.\nAnd the list goes on.\nIn this section, we will look at two popular clustering algorithms: K-Means and\nDBSCAN, and we will show some of their applications, such as non-linear dimensionality\nreduction, semi-supervised learning and anomaly detection.\nK-Means\nConsider the unlabeled dataset represented in Figure 9-2: you can clearly see 5 blobs\nof instances. The K-Means algorithm is a simple algorithm capable of clustering this\nkind of dataset very quickly and efficiently, often in just a few iterations. It was proposed\nby Stuart Lloyd at the Bell Labs in 1957 as a technique for pulse-code modulation,\nbut it was only published outside of the company in 1982, in a paper titled\n“Least square quantization in PCM”.1 By then, in 1965, Edward W.

Let’s train a K-Means clusterer on this dataset. It will try to find each blob’s center and\nassign each instance to the closest blob:\nfrom sklearn.cluster import KMeans\nk = 5\nkmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=k)\ny_pred = kmeans.fit_predict(X)\nNote that you have to specify the number of clusters k that the algorithm must find.\nIn this example, it is pretty obvious from looking at the data that k should be set to 5,\nbut in general it is not that easy. We will discuss this shortly.\nEach instance was assigned to one of the 5 clusters. In the context of clustering, an\ninstance’s label is the index of the cluster that this instance gets assigned to by the\nalgorithm: this is not to be confused with the class labels in classification (remember\nthat clustering is an unsupervised learning task). The KMeans instance preserves a\ncopy of the labels of the instances it was trained on, available via the labels_ instance\nvariable:\n>>> y_pred\narray([4, 0, 1, ..., 2, 1, 0], dtype=int32)\n>>> y_pred is kmeans.labels_\nTrue	{"source": "text.txt"}	76564ae9-f295-11ee-96eb-c475ab433add	efe55a01-6796-48a3-bdf7-b09ceec9bdcc

vast majority of the instances were clearly assigned to the appropriate cluster, but\na few instances were probably mislabeled (especially near the boundary between the\ntop left cluster and the central cluster). Indeed, the K-Means algorithm does not\nbehave very well when the blobs have very different diameters since all it cares about\nwhen assigning an instance to a cluster is the distance to the centroid.\nInstead of assigning each instance to a single cluster, which is called hard clustering, it\ncan be useful to just give each instance a score per cluster: this is called soft clustering.\nFor example, the score can be the distance between the instance and the centroid, or\nconversely it can be a similarity score (or affinity) such as the Gaussian Radial Basis\nFunction (introduced in Chapter 5). In the KMeans class, the transform() method\nmeasures the distance from each instance to every centroid:\n>>> kmeans.transform(X_new)\narray([[2.81093633, 0.32995317, 2.9042344 , 1.49439034, 2.88633901],	{"source": "text.txt"}	76564aeb-f295-11ee-a19c-c475ab433add	bc99954c-dd07-4bcb-a4ce-888d761bb47c

first instance in X_new is located at a distance of 2.81 from the\nfirst centroid, 0.33 from the second centroid, 2.90 from the third centroid, 1.49 from\nthe fourth centroid and 2.87 from the fifth centroid. If you have a high-dimensional\ndataset and you transform it this way, you end up with a k-dimensional dataset: this\ncan be a very efficient non-linear dimensionality reduction technique.\nThe K-Means Algorithm\nSo how does the algorithm work?

instances for each cluster. But you are given neither the labels nor the centroids,\nso how can you proceed? Well, just start by placing the centroids randomly (e.g., by\npicking k instances at random and using their locations as centroids). Then label the\ninstances, update the centroids, label the instances, update the centroids, and so on\nuntil the centroids stop moving. The algorithm is guaranteed to converge in a finite\nnumber of steps (usually quite small), it will not oscillate forever2. You can see the\nalgorithm in action in Figure 9-4: the centroids are initialized randomly (top left),\nthen the instances are labeled (top right), then the centroids are updated (center left),\nthe instances are relabeled (center right), and so on. As you can see, in just 3 iterations\nthe algorithm has reached a clustering that seems close to optimal.\nThe computational complexity of the algorithm is generally linear\nwith regards to the number of instances m, the number of clusters	{"source": "text.txt"}	76564aed-f295-11ee-b65a-c475ab433add	2a4f6609-de5a-419b-bd37-f5fe6e7792df

and the number of dimensions n. However, this is only true when\nthe data has a clustering structure. If it does not, then in the worst\ncase scenario the complexity can increase exponentially with the\nnumber of instances. In practice, however, this rarely happens, and\nK-Means is generally one of the fastest clustering algorithms.\nUnfortunately, although the algorithm is guaranteed to converge, it may not converge\nto the right solution (i.e., it may converge to a local optimum): this depends on the\ncentroid initialization. For example, Figure 9-5 shows two sub-optimal solutions that\nthe algorithm can converge to if you are not lucky with the random initialization step\nCentroid Initialization Methods\nIf you happen to know approximately where the centroids should be (e.g., if you ran\nanother clustering algorithm earlier), then you can set the init hyperparameter to a\nNumPy array containing the list of centroids, and set n_init to 1:\ngood_init = np.array([[-3, 3], [-3, 2], [-3, 1], [-1, 2], [0, 2]])	{"source": "text.txt"}	76564aee-f295-11ee-adf7-c475ab433add	173e658c-a5ed-4c3a-be4f-5c258c1abe8e

= KMeans(n_clusters=5, init=good_init, n_init=1)\nAnother solution is to run the algorithm multiple times with different random initializations\nand keep the best solution. This is controlled by the n_init hyperparameter:\nby default, it is equal to 10, which means that the whole algorithm described earlier\nactually runs 10 times when you call fit(), and Scikit-Learn keeps the best solution.\nBut how exactly does it know which solution is the best? Well of course it uses a performance\nmetric! It is called the model’s inertia: this is the mean squared distance\nbetween each instance and its closest centroid. It is roughly equal to 223.3 for the\nmodel on the left of Figure 9-5, 237.5 for the model on the right of Figure 9-5, and\n211.6 for the model in Figure 9-3.

be selected (unless we are very unlucky with n_init consecutive random initiali?zations). If you are curious, a model’s inertia is accessible via the inertia_ instance\nvariable:\n>>> kmeans.inertia_\n211.59853725816856\nThe score() method returns the negative inertia. Why negative? Well, it is because a\npredictor’s score() method must always respect the "great is better" rule.\n>>> kmeans.score(X)\n-211.59853725816856\nAn important improvement to the K-Means algorithm, called K-Means+\\+, was proposed\nin a 2006 paper by David Arthur and Sergei Vassilvitskii:3 they introduced a\nsmarter initialization step that tends to select centroids that are distant from one\nanother, and this makes the K-Means algorithm much less likely to converge to a suboptimal\nsolution. They showed that the additional computation required for the\nsmarter initialization step is well worth it since it makes it possible to drastically\nreduce the number of times the algorithm needs to be run to find the optimal solution.	{"source": "text.txt"}	76564af0-f295-11ee-ae2c-c475ab433add	aaaeff37-e2e7-43aa-a821-ac44d6aa9a01

is the K-Means++ initialization algorithm:\n• Take one centroid c(1), chosen uniformly at random from the dataset.\n• Take a new centroid c(i), choosing an instance x(i) with probability: D ? i 2\n?j = 1\nm D ? j 2 where D(x(i)) is the distance between the instance x(i) and the closest\ncentroid that was already chosen. This probability distribution ensures that\ninstances further away from already chosen centroids are much more likely be\nselected as centroids.\n• Repeat the previous step until all k centroids have been chosen.\nThe KMeans class actually uses this initialization method by default. If you want to\nforce it to use the original method (i.e., picking k instances randomly to define the\ninitial centroids), then you can set the init hyperparameter to "random".

Early Release ebooks, you get books in their earliest form—\nthe author’s raw and unedited content as he or she writes—so you\ncan take advantage of these technologies long before the official\nrelease of these titles. The following will be Chapter 9 in the final\nrelease of the book.\nAlthough most of the applications of Machine Learning today are based on supervised\nlearning (and as a result, this is where most of the investments go to), the vast\nmajority of the available data is actually unlabeled: we have the input features X, but\nwe do not have the labels y. Yann LeCun famously said that “if intelligence was a cake,\nunsupervised learning would be the cake, supervised learning would be the icing on\nthe cake, and reinforcement learning would be the cherry on the cake”.

a manufacturing production line and detect which items are defective. You can\nfairly easily create a system that will take pictures automatically, and this might give\nyou thousands of pictures every day. You can then build a reasonably large dataset in\njust a few weeks. But wait, there are no labels! If you want to train a regular binary\nclassifier that will predict whether an item is defective or not, you will need to label\nevery single picture as “defective” or “normal”. This will generally require human\nexperts to sit down and manually go through all the pictures. This is a long, costly\nand tedious task, so it will usually only be done on a small subset of the available pictures.\nAs a result, the labeled dataset will be quite small, and the classifier’s performance\nwill be disappointing. Moreover, every time the company makes any change to\nits products, the whole process will need to be started over from scratch.

to label every picture? Enter unsupervised learning.\nIn Chapter 8, we looked at the most common unsupervised learning task: dimensionality\nreduction. In this chapter, we will look at a few more unsupervised learning tasks\nand algorithms:\n• Clustering: the goal is to group similar instances together into clusters. This is a\ngreat tool for data analysis, customer segmentation, recommender systems,\nsearch engines, image segmentation, semi-supervised learning, dimensionality\nreduction, and more.\n• Anomaly detection: the objective is to learn what “normal” data looks like, and\nuse this to detect abnormal instances, such as defective items on a production\nline or a new trend in a time series.\n• Density estimation: this is the task of estimating the probability density function\n(PDF) of the random process that generated the dataset.

for some cake? We will start with clustering, using K-Means and DBSCAN,\nand then we will discuss Gaussian mixture models and see how they can be used for\ndensity estimation, clustering, and anomaly detection. \nClustering\nAs you enjoy a hike in the mountains, you stumble upon a plant you have never seen\nbefore. You look around and you notice a few more. They are not perfectly identical,\nyet they are sufficiently similar for you to know that they most likely belong to the\nsame species (or at least the same genus). You may need a botanist to tell you what\nspecies that is, but you certainly don’t need an expert to identify groups of similarlooking\nobjects. This is called clustering: it is the task of identifying similar instances \nand assigning them to clusters, i.e., groups of similar instances.\nJust like in classification, each instance gets assigned to a group.

4), where each instance’s species (i.e., its class) is represented with a different\nmarker. It is a labeled dataset, for which classification algorithms such as Logistic\nRegression, SVMs or Random Forest classifiers are well suited. On the right is the\nsame dataset, but without the labels, so you cannot use a classification algorithm anymore.\nThis is where clustering algorithms step in: many of them can easily detect the\ntop left cluster. It is also quite easy to see with our own eyes, but it is not so obvious\nthat the lower right cluster is actually composed of two distinct sub-clusters. That\nsaid, the dataset actually has two additional features (sepal length and width), not\n238 |represented here, and clustering algorithms can make good use of all features, so in\nfact they identify the three clusters fairly well (e.g., using a Gaussian mixture model,\nonly 5 instances out of 150 are assigned to the wrong cluster).\nClustering is used in a wide variety of applications, including:	{"source": "text.txt"}	03bb3899-f2a7-11ee-bc4e-c475ab433add	b831411d-f8a0-4fa6-8e46-c3fe8a7b2692

For customer segmentation: you can cluster your customers based on their purchases,\ntheir activity on your website, and so on. This is useful to understand who\nyour customers are and what they need, so you can adapt your products and\nmarketing campaigns to each segment. For example, this can be useful in recommender\nsystems to suggest content that other users in the same cluster enjoyed.\n• For data analysis: when analyzing a new dataset, it is often useful to first discover\nclusters of similar instances, as it is often easier to analyze clusters separately.\n• As a dimensionality reduction technique: once a dataset has been clustered, it is\nusually possible to measure each instance’s affinity with each cluster (affinity is\nany measure of how well an instance fits into a cluster). Each instance’s feature\nvector x can then be replaced with the vector of its cluster affinities. If there are k\nclusters, then this vector is k dimensional.

the original feature vector, but it can preserve enough information for\nfurther processing.\n• For anomaly detection (also called outlier detection): any instance that has a low\naffinity to all the clusters is likely to be an anomaly. For example, if you have clustered\nthe users of your website based on their behavior, you can detect users with\nunusual behavior, such as an unusual number of requests per second, and so on.\nAnomaly detection is particularly useful in detecting defects in manufacturing, or\nfor fraud detection.\n• For semi-supervised learning: if you only have a few labels, you could perform\nclustering and propagate the labels to all the instances in the same cluster. This\ncan greatly increase the amount of labels available for a subsequent supervised\nlearning algorithm, and thus improve its performance.\nFor search engines: for example, some search engines let you search for images\nthat are similar to a reference image.

a clustering algorithm to all the images in your database: similar images\nwould end up in the same cluster. Then when a user provides a reference image,\nall you need to do is to find this image’s cluster using the trained clustering\nmodel, and you can then simply return all the images from this cluster.\n• To segment an image: by clustering pixels according to their color, then replacing\neach pixel’s color with the mean color of its cluster, it is possible to reduce the\nnumber of different colors in the image considerably. This technique is used in\nmany object detection and tracking systems, as it makes it easier to detect the\ncontour of each object.\nThere is no universal definition of what a cluster is: it really depends on the context,\nand different algorithms will capture different kinds of clusters. For example, some\nalgorithms look for instances centered around a particular point, called a centroid.\nOthers look for continuous regions of densely packed instances: these clusters can	{"source": "text.txt"}	03bb389c-f2a7-11ee-a507-c475ab433add	e70b4c58-fee0-46ac-9446-c9ab9ca37097

on any shape. Some algorithms are hierarchical, looking for clusters of clusters.\nAnd the list goes on.\nIn this section, we will look at two popular clustering algorithms: K-Means and\nDBSCAN, and we will show some of their applications, such as non-linear dimensionality\nreduction, semi-supervised learning and anomaly detection.\nK-Means\nConsider the unlabeled dataset represented in Figure 9-2: you can clearly see 5 blobs\nof instances. The K-Means algorithm is a simple algorithm capable of clustering this\nkind of dataset very quickly and efficiently, often in just a few iterations. It was proposed\nby Stuart Lloyd at the Bell Labs in 1957 as a technique for pulse-code modulation,\nbut it was only published outside of the company in 1982, in a paper titled\n“Least square quantization in PCM”.1 By then, in 1965, Edward W.

Let’s train a K-Means clusterer on this dataset. It will try to find each blob’s center and\nassign each instance to the closest blob:\nfrom sklearn.cluster import KMeans\nk = 5\nkmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=k)\ny_pred = kmeans.fit_predict(X)\nNote that you have to specify the number of clusters k that the algorithm must find.\nIn this example, it is pretty obvious from looking at the data that k should be set to 5,\nbut in general it is not that easy. We will discuss this shortly.\nEach instance was assigned to one of the 5 clusters. In the context of clustering, an\ninstance’s label is the index of the cluster that this instance gets assigned to by the\nalgorithm: this is not to be confused with the class labels in classification (remember\nthat clustering is an unsupervised learning task). The KMeans instance preserves a\ncopy of the labels of the instances it was trained on, available via the labels_ instance\nvariable:\n>>> y_pred\narray([4, 0, 1, ..., 2, 1, 0], dtype=int32)\n>>> y_pred is kmeans.labels_\nTrue	{"source": "text.txt"}	03bb389e-f2a7-11ee-86d2-c475ab433add	c27a12a2-5e06-47f1-8c15-c19c915a1469

vast majority of the instances were clearly assigned to the appropriate cluster, but\na few instances were probably mislabeled (especially near the boundary between the\ntop left cluster and the central cluster). Indeed, the K-Means algorithm does not\nbehave very well when the blobs have very different diameters since all it cares about\nwhen assigning an instance to a cluster is the distance to the centroid.\nInstead of assigning each instance to a single cluster, which is called hard clustering, it\ncan be useful to just give each instance a score per cluster: this is called soft clustering.\nFor example, the score can be the distance between the instance and the centroid, or\nconversely it can be a similarity score (or affinity) such as the Gaussian Radial Basis\nFunction (introduced in Chapter 5). In the KMeans class, the transform() method\nmeasures the distance from each instance to every centroid:\n>>> kmeans.transform(X_new)\narray([[2.81093633, 0.32995317, 2.9042344 , 1.49439034, 2.88633901],	{"source": "text.txt"}	03bb38a0-f2a7-11ee-bd8e-c475ab433add	0dec3231-a7fa-445b-bfd6-ec02099a14c8

first instance in X_new is located at a distance of 2.81 from the\nfirst centroid, 0.33 from the second centroid, 2.90 from the third centroid, 1.49 from\nthe fourth centroid and 2.87 from the fifth centroid. If you have a high-dimensional\ndataset and you transform it this way, you end up with a k-dimensional dataset: this\ncan be a very efficient non-linear dimensionality reduction technique.\nThe K-Means Algorithm\nSo how does the algorithm work? Well it is really quite simple. Suppose you were\ngiven the centroids: you could easily label all the instances in the dataset by assigning\neach of them to the cluster whose centroid is closest.

instances for each cluster. But you are given neither the labels nor the centroids,\nso how can you proceed? Well, just start by placing the centroids randomly (e.g., by\npicking k instances at random and using their locations as centroids). Then label the\ninstances, update the centroids, label the instances, update the centroids, and so on\nuntil the centroids stop moving. The algorithm is guaranteed to converge in a finite\nnumber of steps (usually quite small), it will not oscillate forever2. You can see the\nalgorithm in action in Figure 9-4: the centroids are initialized randomly (top left),\nthen the instances are labeled (top right), then the centroids are updated (center left),\nthe instances are relabeled (center right), and so on. As you can see, in just 3 iterations\nthe algorithm has reached a clustering that seems close to optimal.\nThe computational complexity of the algorithm is generally linear\nwith regards to the number of instances m, the number of clusters	{"source": "text.txt"}	03bb38a2-f2a7-11ee-a71a-c475ab433add	864efb44-fe73-44d6-b9fb-a1daa6b29943

and the number of dimensions n. However, this is only true when\nthe data has a clustering structure. If it does not, then in the worst\ncase scenario the complexity can increase exponentially with the\nnumber of instances. In practice, however, this rarely happens, and\nK-Means is generally one of the fastest clustering algorithms.\nUnfortunately, although the algorithm is guaranteed to converge, it may not converge\nto the right solution (i.e., it may converge to a local optimum): this depends on the\ncentroid initialization. For example, Figure 9-5 shows two sub-optimal solutions that\nthe algorithm can converge to if you are not lucky with the random initialization step\nCentroid Initialization Methods\nIf you happen to know approximately where the centroids should be (e.g., if you ran\nanother clustering algorithm earlier), then you can set the init hyperparameter to a\nNumPy array containing the list of centroids, and set n_init to 1:\ngood_init = np.array([[-3, 3], [-3, 2], [-3, 1], [-1, 2], [0, 2]])	{"source": "text.txt"}	03bb38a3-f2a7-11ee-b927-c475ab433add	bf39000c-52b6-47e5-b18e-51d6de9ff926

= KMeans(n_clusters=5, init=good_init, n_init=1)\nAnother solution is to run the algorithm multiple times with different random initializations\nand keep the best solution. This is controlled by the n_init hyperparameter:\nby default, it is equal to 10, which means that the whole algorithm described earlier\nactually runs 10 times when you call fit(), and Scikit-Learn keeps the best solution.\nBut how exactly does it know which solution is the best? Well of course it uses a performance\nmetric! It is called the model’s inertia: this is the mean squared distance\nbetween each instance and its closest centroid. It is roughly equal to 223.3 for the\nmodel on the left of Figure 9-5, 237.5 for the model on the right of Figure 9-5, and\n211.6 for the model in Figure 9-3.

be selected (unless we are very unlucky with n_init consecutive random initiali?zations). If you are curious, a model’s inertia is accessible via the inertia_ instance\nvariable:\n>>> kmeans.inertia_\n211.59853725816856\nThe score() method returns the negative inertia. Why negative? Well, it is because a\npredictor’s score() method must always respect the "great is better" rule.\n>>> kmeans.score(X)\n-211.59853725816856\nAn important improvement to the K-Means algorithm, called K-Means+\\+, was proposed\nin a 2006 paper by David Arthur and Sergei Vassilvitskii:3 they introduced a\nsmarter initialization step that tends to select centroids that are distant from one\nanother, and this makes the K-Means algorithm much less likely to converge to a suboptimal\nsolution. They showed that the additional computation required for the\nsmarter initialization step is well worth it since it makes it possible to drastically\nreduce the number of times the algorithm needs to be run to find the optimal solution.	{"source": "text.txt"}	03bb38a5-f2a7-11ee-bf4e-c475ab433add	88f4e49f-bbb0-4cd0-b719-f729bd57753b

is the K-Means++ initialization algorithm:\n• Take one centroid c(1), chosen uniformly at random from the dataset.\n• Take a new centroid c(i), choosing an instance x(i) with probability: D ? i 2\n?j = 1\nm D ? j 2 where D(x(i)) is the distance between the instance x(i) and the closest\ncentroid that was already chosen. This probability distribution ensures that\ninstances further away from already chosen centroids are much more likely be\nselected as centroids.\n• Repeat the previous step until all k centroids have been chosen.\nThe KMeans class actually uses this initialization method by default. If you want to\nforce it to use the original method (i.e., picking k instances randomly to define the\ninitial centroids), then you can set the init hyperparameter to "random".

Early Release ebooks, you get books in their earliest form—\nthe author’s raw and unedited content as he or she writes—so you\ncan take advantage of these technologies long before the official\nrelease of these titles. The following will be Chapter 9 in the final\nrelease of the book.\nAlthough most of the applications of Machine Learning today are based on supervised\nlearning (and as a result, this is where most of the investments go to), the vast\nmajority of the available data is actually unlabeled: we have the input features X, but\nwe do not have the labels y. Yann LeCun famously said that “if intelligence was a cake,\nunsupervised learning would be the cake, supervised learning would be the icing on\nthe cake, and reinforcement learning would be the cherry on the cake”.

a manufacturing production line and detect which items are defective. You can\nfairly easily create a system that will take pictures automatically, and this might give\nyou thousands of pictures every day. You can then build a reasonably large dataset in\njust a few weeks. But wait, there are no labels! If you want to train a regular binary\nclassifier that will predict whether an item is defective or not, you will need to label\nevery single picture as “defective” or “normal”. This will generally require human\nexperts to sit down and manually go through all the pictures. This is a long, costly\nand tedious task, so it will usually only be done on a small subset of the available pictures.\nAs a result, the labeled dataset will be quite small, and the classifier’s performance\nwill be disappointing. Moreover, every time the company makes any change to\nits products, the whole process will need to be started over from scratch.

to label every picture? Enter unsupervised learning.\nIn Chapter 8, we looked at the most common unsupervised learning task: dimensionality\nreduction. In this chapter, we will look at a few more unsupervised learning tasks\nand algorithms:\n• Clustering: the goal is to group similar instances together into clusters. This is a\ngreat tool for data analysis, customer segmentation, recommender systems,\nsearch engines, image segmentation, semi-supervised learning, dimensionality\nreduction, and more.\n• Anomaly detection: the objective is to learn what “normal” data looks like, and\nuse this to detect abnormal instances, such as defective items on a production\nline or a new trend in a time series.\n• Density estimation: this is the task of estimating the probability density function\n(PDF) of the random process that generated the dataset.

for some cake? We will start with clustering, using K-Means and DBSCAN,\nand then we will discuss Gaussian mixture models and see how they can be used for\ndensity estimation, clustering, and anomaly detection. \nClustering\nAs you enjoy a hike in the mountains, you stumble upon a plant you have never seen\nbefore. You look around and you notice a few more. They are not perfectly identical,\nyet they are sufficiently similar for you to know that they most likely belong to the\nsame species (or at least the same genus). You may need a botanist to tell you what\nspecies that is, but you certainly don’t need an expert to identify groups of similarlooking\nobjects. This is called clustering: it is the task of identifying similar instances \nand assigning them to clusters, i.e., groups of similar instances.\nJust like in classification, each instance gets assigned to a group.

4), where each instance’s species (i.e., its class) is represented with a different\nmarker. It is a labeled dataset, for which classification algorithms such as Logistic\nRegression, SVMs or Random Forest classifiers are well suited. On the right is the\nsame dataset, but without the labels, so you cannot use a classification algorithm anymore.\nThis is where clustering algorithms step in: many of them can easily detect the\ntop left cluster. It is also quite easy to see with our own eyes, but it is not so obvious\nthat the lower right cluster is actually composed of two distinct sub-clusters. That\nsaid, the dataset actually has two additional features (sepal length and width), not\n238 |represented here, and clustering algorithms can make good use of all features, so in\nfact they identify the three clusters fairly well (e.g., using a Gaussian mixture model,\nonly 5 instances out of 150 are assigned to the wrong cluster).\nClustering is used in a wide variety of applications, including:	{"source": "text.txt"}	0d1f36b1-f2a7-11ee-81f6-c475ab433add	239900a1-1dec-45d6-bd24-4adb04b466cf

For customer segmentation: you can cluster your customers based on their purchases,\ntheir activity on your website, and so on. This is useful to understand who\nyour customers are and what they need, so you can adapt your products and\nmarketing campaigns to each segment. For example, this can be useful in recommender\nsystems to suggest content that other users in the same cluster enjoyed.\n• For data analysis: when analyzing a new dataset, it is often useful to first discover\nclusters of similar instances, as it is often easier to analyze clusters separately.\n• As a dimensionality reduction technique: once a dataset has been clustered, it is\nusually possible to measure each instance’s affinity with each cluster (affinity is\nany measure of how well an instance fits into a cluster). Each instance’s feature\nvector x can then be replaced with the vector of its cluster affinities. If there are k\nclusters, then this vector is k dimensional.

clusters is likely to be an anomaly. For example, if you have clustered\nthe users of your website based on their behavior, you can detect users with\nunusual behavior, such as an unusual number of requests per second, and so on.\nAnomaly detection is particularly useful in detecting defects in manufacturing, or\nfor fraud detection.\n• For semi-supervised learning: if you only have a few labels, you could perform\nclustering and propagate the labels to all the instances in the same cluster. This\ncan greatly increase the amount of labels available for a subsequent supervised\nlearning algorithm, and thus improve its performance.\nFor search engines: for example, some search engines let you search for images\nthat are similar to a reference image.

a clustering algorithm to all the images in your database: similar images\nwould end up in the same cluster. Then when a user provides a reference image,\nall you need to do is to find this image’s cluster using the trained clustering\nmodel, and you can then simply return all the images from this cluster.\n• To segment an image: by clustering pixels according to their color, then replacing\neach pixel’s color with the mean color of its cluster, it is possible to reduce the\nnumber of different colors in the image considerably. This technique is used in\nmany object detection and tracking systems, as it makes it easier to detect the\ncontour of each object.\nThere is no universal definition of what a cluster is: it really depends on the context,\nand different algorithms will capture different kinds of clusters. For example, some\nalgorithms look for instances centered around a particular point, called a centroid.\nOthers look for continuous regions of densely packed instances: these clusters can	{"source": "text.txt"}	0d1f36b4-f2a7-11ee-bc13-c475ab433add	60f2fdea-b889-49bb-b987-bb9064bb670c

on any shape. Some algorithms are hierarchical, looking for clusters of clusters.\nAnd the list goes on.\nIn this section, we will look at two popular clustering algorithms: K-Means and\nDBSCAN, and we will show some of their applications, such as non-linear dimensionality\nreduction, semi-supervised learning and anomaly detection.\nK-Means\nConsider the unlabeled dataset represented in Figure 9-2: you can clearly see 5 blobs\nof instances. The K-Means algorithm is a simple algorithm capable of clustering this\nkind of dataset very quickly and efficiently, often in just a few iterations. It was proposed\nby Stuart Lloyd at the Bell Labs in 1957 as a technique for pulse-code modulation,\nbut it was only published outside of the company in 1982, in a paper titled\n“Least square quantization in PCM”.1 By then, in 1965, Edward W.

Let’s train a K-Means clusterer on this dataset. It will try to find each blob’s center and\nassign each instance to the closest blob:\nfrom sklearn.cluster import KMeans\nk = 5\nkmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=k)\ny_pred = kmeans.fit_predict(X)\nNote that you have to specify the number of clusters k that the algorithm must find.\nIn this example, it is pretty obvious from looking at the data that k should be set to 5,\nbut in general it is not that easy. We will discuss this shortly.\nEach instance was assigned to one of the 5 clusters. In the context of clustering, an\ninstance’s label is the index of the cluster that this instance gets assigned to by the\nalgorithm: this is not to be confused with the class labels in classification (remember\nthat clustering is an unsupervised learning task). The KMeans instance preserves a\ncopy of the labels of the instances it was trained on, available via the labels_ instance\nvariable:\n>>> y_pred\narray([4, 0, 1, ..., 2, 1, 0], dtype=int32)\n>>> y_pred is kmeans.labels_\nTrue	{"source": "text.txt"}	0d1f36b6-f2a7-11ee-8ffa-c475ab433add	a35eb46a-0030-46de-9bd3-5d7ab72ec1bb

vast majority of the instances were clearly assigned to the appropriate cluster, but\na few instances were probably mislabeled (especially near the boundary between the\ntop left cluster and the central cluster). Indeed, the K-Means algorithm does not\nbehave very well when the blobs have very different diameters since all it cares about\nwhen assigning an instance to a cluster is the distance to the centroid.\nInstead of assigning each instance to a single cluster, which is called hard clustering, it\ncan be useful to just give each instance a score per cluster: this is called soft clustering.\nFor example, the score can be the distance between the instance and the centroid, or\nconversely it can be a similarity score (or affinity) such as the Gaussian Radial Basis\nFunction (introduced in Chapter 5). In the KMeans class, the transform() method\nmeasures the distance from each instance to every centroid:\n>>> kmeans.transform(X_new)\narray([[2.81093633, 0.32995317, 2.9042344 , 1.49439034, 2.88633901],	{"source": "text.txt"}	0d1f36b8-f2a7-11ee-8070-c475ab433add	479fa9f9-3a83-4808-bdc0-a2aa35ee2156

first instance in X_new is located at a distance of 2.81 from the\nfirst centroid, 0.33 from the second centroid, 2.90 from the third centroid, 1.49 from\nthe fourth centroid and 2.87 from the fifth centroid. If you have a high-dimensional\ndataset and you transform it this way, you end up with a k-dimensional dataset: this\ncan be a very efficient non-linear dimensionality reduction technique.\nThe K-Means Algorithm\nSo how does the algorithm work? Well it is really quite simple. Suppose you were\ngiven the centroids: you could easily label all the instances in the dataset by assigning\neach of them to the cluster whose centroid is closest.

instances for each cluster. But you are given neither the labels nor the centroids,\nso how can you proceed? Well, just start by placing the centroids randomly (e.g., by\npicking k instances at random and using their locations as centroids). Then label the\ninstances, update the centroids, label the instances, update the centroids, and so on\nuntil the centroids stop moving. The algorithm is guaranteed to converge in a finite\nnumber of steps (usually quite small), it will not oscillate forever2. You can see the\nalgorithm in action in Figure 9-4: the centroids are initialized randomly (top left),\nthen the instances are labeled (top right), then the centroids are updated (center left),\nthe instances are relabeled (center right), and so on. As you can see, in just 3 iterations\nthe algorithm has reached a clustering that seems close to optimal.\nThe computational complexity of the algorithm is generally linear\nwith regards to the number of instances m, the number of clusters	{"source": "text.txt"}	0d1f36ba-f2a7-11ee-9365-c475ab433add	0a18b418-1d28-4bb4-98a2-355dc54dcbb5

and the number of dimensions n. However, this is only true when\nthe data has a clustering structure. If it does not, then in the worst\ncase scenario the complexity can increase exponentially with the\nnumber of instances. In practice, however, this rarely happens, and\nK-Means is generally one of the fastest clustering algorithms.\nUnfortunately, although the algorithm is guaranteed to converge, it may not converge\nto the right solution (i.e., it may converge to a local optimum): this depends on the\ncentroid initialization. For example, Figure 9-5 shows two sub-optimal solutions that\nthe algorithm can converge to if you are not lucky with the random initialization step\nCentroid Initialization Methods\nIf you happen to know approximately where the centroids should be (e.g., if you ran\nanother clustering algorithm earlier), then you can set the init hyperparameter to a\nNumPy array containing the list of centroids, and set n_init to 1:\ngood_init = np.array([[-3, 3], [-3, 2], [-3, 1], [-1, 2], [0, 2]])	{"source": "text.txt"}	0d1f36bb-f2a7-11ee-9e24-c475ab433add	880df8f9-fe0e-466f-911d-043162bca0f9

= KMeans(n_clusters=5, init=good_init, n_init=1)\nAnother solution is to run the algorithm multiple times with different random initializations\nand keep the best solution. This is controlled by the n_init hyperparameter:\nby default, it is equal to 10, which means that the whole algorithm described earlier\nactually runs 10 times when you call fit(), and Scikit-Learn keeps the best solution.\nBut how exactly does it know which solution is the best? Well of course it uses a performance\nmetric! It is called the model’s inertia: this is the mean squared distance\nbetween each instance and its closest centroid. It is roughly equal to 223.3 for the\nmodel on the left of Figure 9-5, 237.5 for the model on the right of Figure 9-5, and\n211.6 for the model in Figure 9-3.

be selected (unless we are very unlucky with n_init consecutive random initiali?zations). If you are curious, a model’s inertia is accessible via the inertia_ instance\nvariable:\n>>> kmeans.inertia_\n211.59853725816856\nThe score() method returns the negative inertia. Why negative? Well, it is because a\npredictor’s score() method must always respect the "great is better" rule.\n>>> kmeans.score(X)\n-211.59853725816856\nAn important improvement to the K-Means algorithm, called K-Means+\\+, was proposed\nin a 2006 paper by David Arthur and Sergei Vassilvitskii:3 they introduced a\nsmarter initialization step that tends to select centroids that are distant from one\nanother, and this makes the K-Means algorithm much less likely to converge to a suboptimal\nsolution. They showed that the additional computation required for the\nsmarter initialization step is well worth it since it makes it possible to drastically\nreduce the number of times the algorithm needs to be run to find the optimal solution.	{"source": "text.txt"}	0d1f36bd-f2a7-11ee-a921-c475ab433add	4ae595ed-7b9e-46ef-b168-a0f395f85be8

is the K-Means++ initialization algorithm:\n• Take one centroid c(1), chosen uniformly at random from the dataset.\n• Take a new centroid c(i), choosing an instance x(i) with probability: D ? i 2\n?j = 1\nm D ? j 2 where D(x(i)) is the distance between the instance x(i) and the closest\ncentroid that was already chosen. This probability distribution ensures that\ninstances further away from already chosen centroids are much more likely be\nselected as centroids.\n• Repeat the previous step until all k centroids have been chosen.\nThe KMeans class actually uses this initialization method by default. If you want to\nforce it to use the original method (i.e., picking k instances randomly to define the\ninitial centroids), then you can set the init hyperparameter to "random". You will\nrarely need to do this.	{"source": "text.txt"}	0d1f36be-f2a7-11ee-9038-c475ab433add	ba6325e6-ffd2-4018-a055-68f485062f6b
